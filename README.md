# Weather App

Welcome to the Weather App! This Android application provides accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts for any city in the world. The app uses data from the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to provide a 24-hour weather forecast for a selected city. The background image of the app changes dynamically based on whether it is day or night in the selected city.

## Features

- **Search by City**: Users can search for any city by name to get the current weather and a 24-hour forecast.
- **24-Hour Forecast**: Detailed weather information for the next 24 hours, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Dynamic Background**: The background image changes to reflect day or night based on the selected city's local time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for a seamless user experience.
